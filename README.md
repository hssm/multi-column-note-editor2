Anki add-on that alters the note editor to arrange fields inside a configurable number of columns instead of the default one-per-line.

TODO:
- Better expand/contract button style
- Field height doesn't equialize per row (maybe this way is better?)

Known issues:
- Editing the note model to change the number or order of fields will scramble the column width settings. The add-on can only target field index, so if the index changes, too bad.
