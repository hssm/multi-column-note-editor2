This Anki add-on lets you change the note editor to see your fields inside multiple columns. A new input box at the bottom of the window allows you to easily and quickly change how many columns you see. Each note type can have its own custom number of columns, and any field with a lot of content can be toggled to take up a full line again.

Known issues:
- (wontfix) Modifying the field order in the note model may scramble field settings since we can only target the field index. Manually redoing your columns takes 2 seconds, so do that.
